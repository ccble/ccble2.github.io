	<h1>About Me</h1>
	<p>My name is Abai, and I'm a freshman at AlaToo International University in Kyrgyzstan. I'm studying applied math and informatics, and I'm really enjoying my classes so far. I'm originally from a small town in the south of Kyrgyzstan called Batken, but I moved to the capital city, Bishkek, to attend university.</p>
	<p>Despite being from a small town, I've always been curious about the world around me. I'm excited to be studying at AlaToo and meeting people from different backgrounds and cultures.</p>
	<p>One of the things I love about Kyrgyzstan is its beautiful natural landscapes. We have mountains, lakes, and valleys that are truly breathtaking. I'm also proud of our rich cultural heritage, which includes traditional music, dance, and crafts.</p>
	<p>When I'm not studying, I like to explore the city and try new foods. Bishkek has a vibrant food scene with lots of different cuisines to choose from. I also enjoy playing soccer with my friends and watching movies.</p>
	<p>Thanks for taking the time to learn a little bit about me. I'm excited to see where my studies at AlaToo take me, and I'm looking forward to making new friends along the way.</p>
